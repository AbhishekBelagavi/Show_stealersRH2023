# FindTheMissing

## Project Overview

FindTheMissing is an innovative solution aimed at revolutionizing missing persons/children tracking using Aadhaar-enabled biometric technology. It bridges the gap between the public and law enforcement to fast-track missing person searches. This cutting-edge project leverages the power of facial recognition, fingerprint detection, machine learning, and more to make it the most effective choice for addressing the challenge of missing persons.
